The main content file is `body.tex`.  The formatted output viewer page is [here](http://sbmlteam.github.io/nih-response-15-002/).

## If you want to edit directly from here, in your browser

Click on the file name in the list above.  GitHub will present an editing interface.  Look near the top of the file for the pencil icon,

![github-edit-buttons](https://github.com/sbmlteam/nih-response-15-002/raw/master/.readme/github-edit-buttons.png)

and click on it.  Before going further, you will want to change the editor settings.  Look again in the same upper right hand area for the new set of buttons:

![github-edit-buttons](https://github.com/sbmlteam/nih-response-15-002/raw/master/.readme/github-nowrap.png)

Do 3 things: (1) click the "nowrap" button and select "Soft wrap" from the pop-up menu, (2) click the "spaces" button and select "Tabs" from the menu, and finally, (3) click the "2" and change the indent size to "8".

(Sorry, there's no way to set defaults for GitHub's editor.)


## If you want to edit in a desktop editor

You will need to git clone the repository, push your changes back to the repository, regularly check for updates to the repository and git pull updates when needed.  If this is unfamiliar, you may want to download one of the following desktop git clients, which provide nice GUI interfaces for these tasks and monitor the repository for remote changes.

* [Windows GitHub client](https://windows.github.com)
* [Mac GitHub  client](https://mac.github.com)
* Linux users may want to look at the 3rd-party git clients [listed here](http://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux)

To learn how to use git, here are two good resources:
